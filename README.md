# Organizing Map Folders
Custom maps should be kept in a sub-directory of your EverQuest map directory. For example,

```
C:\users\public\Everquest\maps\Good's Maps 
C:\users\public\Everquest\maps\Collection Ground Spawns
C:\users\public\Everquest\maps\Brewall's Maps  
```


In-game, you switch between map folders via a dropdown in the top left corner of the map.

### Key

(GM) = Grand Master                  
(Q) = Quest                          
(T) = Solo Task  
(Mi) = Mission  
(M) = Merchant  
(R) = Raid  
(GS) = Ground Spawn  
(S) = Spell  
(D) = Disc  
(P) = Parcel  

`Blue` = for non agro NPCs  
`Dark` Blue = NPCs that are involved in a quest but does not start it. Spells/discs vendors also get to be dark!  
`Dark` Turquoise for the GMs in town or instances information inside agressive zones.  
`Red` = Hunter achievement bosses  
`Dark red`  = Quests target with medium size(2) and raid bosses with large size(3)
`Black` = ground spawn and quest updates  
`Dark Orange` = Zones Areas  
`Pink` = Zone lines and portals  

`*` = Roaming NPCs  

Base: The Zone lines  
Layer 1: Non agro NPCs: (M)erchants, (T)asks, (Q)uests, (Mi)ssions (R)aid etc.  
Layer 2: Quests/Tasks/Missions informations and updates, ground spawn, containers, camp or any usefull zone informations.  
Layer 3: Zone Wide Rare often used for achievements or treasures dropper. Will also use layer 3 in towns and non agressive zones to isolate layer 1 from been over crowded. Making them often hard to read. In that case, guild masters and spell/disc vendors will be moved there.
